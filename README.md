🚀 Overview of the Study

Distributed hydrological models include many spatially distributed parameters whose importance varies across both space and time. Traditional sensitivity analysis often collapses space or time into a single dimension, missing important dynamics.

This study proposes a two-step deep learning-assisted time-varying spatial sensitivity analysis (SSA) framework to identify dominant parameters across multiple scales:

Step 1: Screening
A spatially lumped Morris method identifies influential parameters.

Step 2: Time-varying SSA
Multilayer perceptron (MLP) surrogates approximate SWAT outputs, enabling efficient Sobol sensitivity analysis across rolling windows.

The method is tested in the Jinghe River Basin using parameters defined at both subbasin and hydrological response unit (HRU) scales.

🔍 Key Features

✔ Two-scale parameterization (subbasin + HRU)
✔ Time-varying Sobol sensitivity indices
✔ 3- and 24-month rolling windows for temporal dynamics
✔ MLP surrogate models for computational efficiency
✔ Spatial hotspot and temporal hot moment detection
✔ Reproducible figure-by-figure code structure
